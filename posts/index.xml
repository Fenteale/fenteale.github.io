I plan on using this blog section to post about various topics that I spend time researching or figuring out. For example, I plan on making the first real post on here about my research into static site generators, and why I chose Hugo over other ones such as Jekyll.
If you ever have questions over any of the topics I cover, or have any comments to make, please feel free to visit my contact page to reach out to me.</description></item></channel></rss>
